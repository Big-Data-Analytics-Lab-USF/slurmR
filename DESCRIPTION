Description: 'Slurm', Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
          <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>, is a popular 'Linux' based software used to 
          schedule jobs in 'HPC' (High Performance Computing) clusters. This R package
          provides a specialized lightweight wrapper of 'Slurm' with a syntax similar to
          that found in the 'parallel' R package. The package also includes a method for
          creating socket cluster objects spanning multiple nodes that can be used with
          the 'parallel' package.

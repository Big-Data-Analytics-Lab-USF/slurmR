# Introduccion

[Slurm Work Manager]() (formerly *Simple Linux Utility for Resource Manager*), 

Some important definitions

1.  **Node** A single computer in the HPC.
2.  **Partition** A group of nodes in HPC (see `--partition`).
3.  **Account** Accounts associated with partitions. Accounts can have privileges to use a partition or set of nodes. (see `--account`)
4.  **Job** A job submited to slurm either via `sbatch`, `salloc`, or `srun`.
5.  **Task** A step within a job. A particular job can have multiple tasks.
6.  **CPU** (see `--cpus-per-task`, `--`)

https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html

> Unless overcommitment of CPUs to tasks is specified for the job, the number of tasks distributed to a node is constrained by the number of CPUs allocated on the node and the number of CPUs per task -- [Slurm CPU Management](https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html)

# Implementation of the `sluRrm` package

Just like `rslurm`, `sluRm` has two levels of job distribution: Slurm Jobs (via
the `Slurm_lapply` function), and within each job via `parallel::mclapply` (task
forking).

In general, the function `Slurm_lapply` is implemented as follows:

1.  List whatever R packages are loaded, including the path to the R package.

2.  List all the objects passed via elipsis (`...`), and, together with `X` and
    `FUN`, save them at `[job_path]/[job_name]/` as `[object-name].rds`.

3.  Write out the corresponding R script and Slurm bash file, and save them as
    `[job_path]/[job_name]/00-rscript.r`, and `[job_path]/[job_name]/01-bash.sh`
    respectively.

4.  If `submit = TRUE` (the default), the job will be submitted to the queue,
    which implies that `Slurm_lapply` will call `sbatch()`. Then return.
    
5.  Once `sbatch()` is called, a Job Array will be submitted in which each R
    job will lunch up to `mc.cores` forked processes (2nd layer of parallelization)
    
    
Users can collect their results using the function `Slurm_collect`.
  

# Examples

## Simulating Pi

We would like to implement a simulation algorithm to be run in a cluster. In this
case, we have the very simple function we would like to parallelize:

```r
simpi <- function(n) {
  points <- matrix(runif(n*2), ncol=2)
  mean(rowSums(points^2) <= 1)*4
}
```

This simple function generates Pi. Using `parallel::mclapply`, we could just type

```r
set.seed(12)
ans <- parallel::mclapply(rep(1e6, 100), simpi)
mean(unlist(ans))
```

But there's another way, using `Slurm_lapply`, we can write

```{r slurm-opts, warning=FALSE}
library(sluRm)

# Setting required parameters
opts_sluRm$set_chdir(tempdir())
opts_sluRm$set_job_name("test1")

# Optional parameters are set via set_opts
opts_sluRm$set_opts(partition="conti", account="lc_dvc")

# We can look at the setup
opts_sluRm
```


```r
job <- Slurm_lapply(rep(1e6, 100), simpi, njobs=10, mc.cores=10, wait = TRUE)
ans <- Slurm_collect(job)
mean(unlist(ans))
```



```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH
Rscript --vanilla myjob.R
```

```bash
$ sbatch run_jobs.sh
```

```r
library(sluRm)
library(parallel) # Example library you would like to load

dat <- sample.int(1000, 10, TRUE)
job <- Slurm_lapply(dat, mean, wait = TRUE)

ans <- Slurm_collect(job)
ans
```
# Common options to pass via `sbatch_opt`

Options to `sbatch` can be passed via `sbatch_opt` as a list. For example, the
following

```r
list(
  `job-name`    = "my-fancy-slurm-job",
  `mem-per-cpu` = "4G",
  time          = "12:00:00",
  ntasks        = 10
)
```

Advices Slurm to allocate 4G of memory per task, set a maximum time limit of 12
hours, and specify that you will be running 10 tasks per job.

A comprehensive list of options can be found [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).

# Appendix

Extract from the FAQs at the Slurm website:

> **30. Slurm documentation refers to CPUs, cores and threads. What exactly is considered a CPU?**
If your nodes are configured with hyperthreading, then a CPU is equivalent to a hyperthread. Otherwise a CPU is equivalent to a core. You can determine if your nodes have more than one thread per core using the command "scontrol show node" and looking at the values of "ThreadsPerCore".
>
> *Note that even on systems with hyperthreading enabled, the resources will generally be allocated to jobs at the level of a core* (see NOTE below). Two different jobs will not share a core except through the use of a partition OverSubscribe configuration parameter. For example, a job requesting resources for three tasks on a node with ThreadsPerCore=2 will be allocated two full cores. Note that Slurm commands contain a multitude of options to control resource allocation with respect to base boards, sockets, cores and threads. --- [FAQ #30](https://slurm.schedmd.com/faq.html#cpu_count)

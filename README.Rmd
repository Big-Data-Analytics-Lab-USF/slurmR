# slurmR: A Lightweight Wrapper for Slurm <img src="man/figures/logo.png" height="180px" align="right"/>

Slurm Workload Manager is a popular HPC cluster job scheduler found in many of the top 500 supercomputers. The `slurmR` R package provides an R wrapper to it that matches the parallel package's syntax, this is, just like `parallel` provides the `parLapply`, `clusterMap`, `parSapply`, etc., `slurmR` provides `Slurm_lapply`, `Slurm_Map`, `Slurm_sapply`, etc.

While there are other alternatives such as `future.batchtools`, `batchtools`, `clustermq`, and `rslurm`, this R package has the following goals:

1.  It is dependency-free, which means that it works out-of-the-box

2.  Emphasizes been similar to the workflow in the R package `parallel`

3.  It provides a general framework for creating personalized own wrappers without using template files.

4.  Is specialized on Slurm, meaning more flexibility (no need to modify template files), and, in the future, better debugging tools (e.g., job resubmission).

5.  Provide a backend for the
    [parallel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing)
    package, providing an out-of-the-box method for creating Socket cluster objects for multi-node operations. (See the examples below on how to use it with other R packages)

# Installation

From your HPC command line, you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/USCbiostats/slurmR.git
$ R CMD INSTALL slurmR/ 
```

The second line assumes you have R available in your system (usually loaded via
`module R` or some other command). Or using the `devtools` from within R:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USCbiostats/slurmR")
```

# Citation

```{r cite, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
citation("slurmR")
```

# Running slurmR with Docker

For testing purposes, slurmR is available in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/uscbiostats/slurmr).
The `rcmdcheck` and `interactive` images are built on top of
[`xenonmiddleware/slurm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/xenonmiddleware/slurm).

Once you download the files contained in the [`slurmR` repository](https://github.com/USCbiostats/slurmR),
you can go to the `docker` folder and use the `Makefile` included
there to start a Unix session with slurmR and Slurm included.

To test `slurmR` using docker, check the README.md file located at
https://github.com/USCbiostats/slurmR/tree/master/docker.


# Examples

## Example 1: Computing means (and looking under the hood)

```{r simple-example}
library(slurmR)

# Suppose that we have 100 vectors of length 50 ~ Unif(0,1)
set.seed(881)
x <- replicate(100, runif(50), simplify = FALSE)
```

We can use the function `Slurm_lapply` to distribute computations

```{r example1}
ans <- Slurm_lapply(x, mean, plan = "none")
Slurm_clean(ans) # Cleaning after you
```

Notice the `plan = "none"` option; this tells `Slurm_lapply` to only create the job object but do nothing with it, i.e., skip submission. To get more info, we can set the verbose mode on

```{r example1-with-verb}
opts_slurmR$verbose_on()
ans <- Slurm_lapply(x, mean, plan = "none")
Slurm_clean(ans) # Cleaning after you
```

## Example 2: Job resubmission 

The following example was extracted from the package's manual.

```r
# Submitting a simple job
job <- Slurm_EvalQ(slurmR::WhoAmI(), njobs = 20, plan = "submit")

# Checking the status of the job (we can simply print)
job
status(job) # or use the state function
sacct(job) # or get more info with the sactt wrapper.

# Suppose some of the jobs are taking too long to complete (say 1, 2, and 15 through 20)
# we can stop it and resubmit the job as follows:
scancel(job)

# Resubmitting only 
sbatch(job, array = "1,2,15-20") # A new jobid will be assigned

# Once its done, we can collect all the results at once
res <- Slurm_collect(job)

# And clean up if we don't need to use it again
Slurm_clean(res)
```

Take a look at the vignette [here](vignettes/getting-started.Rmd).

## Example 3: Using slurmR and future/doParallel/boot/... 

The function `makeSlurmCluster` creates a PSOCK cluster within a Slurm HPC network,
meaning that users can go beyond a single node cluster object and take advantage
of Slurm to create a multi-node cluster object. This feature allows then using
`slurmR` with other R packages that support working with `SOCKcluster` class objects. Here are some examples

With the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) package

```r
library(future)
library(slurmR)

cl <- makeSlurmCluster(50)

# It only takes using a cluster plan!
plan(cluster, cl)

...your fancy futuristic code...

# Slurm Clusters are stopped in the same way any cluster object is
stopCluster(cl)
```

With the [`doParallel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=doParallel) package

```r
library(doParallel)
library(slurmR)

cl <- makeSlurmCluster(50)

registerDoParallel(cl)
m <- matrix(rnorm(9), 3, 3)
foreach(i=1:nrow(m), .combine=rbind) 

stopCluster(cl)
```

## Example 4: Using slurmR directly from the command line

The `slurmR` package has a couple of convenient functions designed for the user
to save time. First, the function `sourceSlurm()` allows skipping the explicit
creating of a bash script file to be used together with `sbatch` by putting all
the required config files on the first lines of an R scripts, for example:

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat("```\n")
cat(readLines(system.file("example.R", package="slurmR")), sep="\n")
cat("```\n")
```

Is an R script that on the first line coincides with that of a bash script for
Slurm: `#!/bin/bash`. The following lines start with `#SBATCH` explicitly
specifying options for `sbatch`, and the reminder lines are just R code.

The previous R script is included in the package (type `system.file("example.R", package="slurmR")`).

Imagine that that R script is named `example.R`, then you use the `sourceSlurm`
function to submit it to Slurm as follows:

```r
slurmR::sourceSlurm("example.R")
```

This will create the corresponding bash file required to be used with `sbatch`,
and submit it to Slurm.

Another nice tool is the `slurmr_cmd()`. This function will create a simple bash-script
that we can use as a command-line tool to submit this type of R-scripts.
Moreover, this command will can add the command to your session's
[**alias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(command)) as follows:

```r
library(slurmR)
slurmr_cmd("~", add_alias = TRUE)
```

Once that's done, you can submit R scripts with "Slurm-like headers" (as
shown previously) as follows:

```bash
$ slurmr example.R
```

## Example 5: Using the preamble

Since version 0.4-3, `slurmR` includes the option `preamble`. This provides a way
for the user to specify commands/modules that need to be executed before running
the Rscript. Here is an example using `module load`:

```{r preamble, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Turning the verbose mode off
opts_slurmR$verbose_off()

# Setting the preamble can be done globally
opts_slurmR$set_preamble("module load gcc/6.0")

# Or on the fly
ans <- Slurm_lapply(1:10, mean, plan = "none", preamble = "module load pandoc")

# Printing out the bashfile
cat(readLines(ans$bashfile), sep = "\n")

Slurm_clean(ans) # Cleaning after you
```

## VS 

There are several ways to enhance R for HPC. Depending on what are your goals/restrictions/preferences, you can use any of the following from this **manually curated** list:


```{r vs-table, echo = FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("comparing-projects.csv", check.names = FALSE)
dat$Dependencies <- sprintf("[![status](https://tinyverse.netlify.com/badge/%s)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=%1$s)", dat$Package)
dat$Activity <- sprintf("[![Activity](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/%s)](https://github.com/%1$s)", dat$github)

dat$Package <- sprintf("[**%s**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=%1$s)", dat$Package)

# Packages that only work with Slurm
only_w_slurm <- dat$Package[dat$`System [blank]` == "specific"]
only_w_slurm <- paste(only_w_slurm, collapse = ", ")

dat$github <- NULL
dat$`System [blank]` <- NULL
dat$`Focus on [blank]` <- NULL
knitr::kable(dat)
```

(1) After errors, the part or the entire job can be resubmitted.
(2) Functionality similar to the apply family in base R, e.g., lapply, sapply, mapply or similar.
(3) Creating a cluster object using either MPI or Socket connection.


The packages `r only_w_slurm` work only on Slurm. The [**drake**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake) package is focused on workflows.
